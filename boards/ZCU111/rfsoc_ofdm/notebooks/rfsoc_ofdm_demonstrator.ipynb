    "The OFDM system starts with generation of random data symbols from 1 of 10 possible modulation schemes (BPSK to 1024 QAM), based on input provided from PYNQ. In accordance with the procedure used in the IEEE 802.11a/g standard, the symbols are grouped into blocks of 48 for mapping to sub-carriers. The OFDM symbol consists of 48 data sub-carriers, 4 pilot sub-carriers and 12 null sub-carriers (including DC). The final OFDM symbol is created by performing a 64 point IFFT and adding a 16 sample Cyclic Prefix (CP). The transmitted signal consists of a continuous stream of OFDM symbols. At the very beginning of the data stream, the L-STF and L-LTF training symbols from the IEEE 802.11a/g standard are transmitted, to aid synchronisation and channel estimation tasks in the receiver. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the receiver, timing and frequency synchronisation are performed to acquire symbol timing and correct for any frequency offsets. Once timing is achieved, the FFT is performed to recover the underlying data symbols in each OFDM symbol. The L-LTF symbols are used to estimate the channel frequency response at each sub-carrier position, which subsequently allows the data to be equalised. Finally, the pilot symbols are used to correct for residual phase errors in the phase tracking stage. The recovered symbols are then passed into the PS for visualisation in PYNQ."

    "    In this demonstration, we generate signals using the RFSoC development board. Your device should be setup in loopback mode. You should understand that the RFSoC platform can also transmit RF signals wirelessly. Remember that unlicensed wireless transmission of RF signals may be illegal in your geographical location. Radio signals may also interfere with nearby devices, such as pacemakers and emergency radio equipment. Note that it is also illegal to intercept and decode particular RF signals. If you are unsure, please seek professional support.\n",

    "The setup for the OFDM demonstration system is nearly complete. The majority of the libraries used by the demonstrator design are contained inside the RFSoC-OFDM software package. We only need to run a few code cells to initialise the environment."
