# RFSoC OFDM Transceiver
This repository contains an RFSoC demonstration of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transceiver. The OFDM system is only compatible with [PYNQ images v2.7 and greater](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ/releases) for the [ZCU111](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu111.html) and the [RFSoC2x2](http://rfsoc-pynq.io/).

## Quick Start
Follow the instructions below to install the OFDM demonstrator on your development board. **You will need to give your board access to the internet**.
* Power on your RFSoC development board with an SD Card containing a fresh PYNQ v2.7 image.
* Navigate to Jupyter Labs by opening a browser (preferably Chrome) and connecting to `http://<board_ip_address>:9090/lab`.
* We need to open a terminal in Jupyter Lab. Firstly, open a launcher window as shown in the figure below:

<p/>

* Now open a terminal in Jupyter as illustrated below:

<p/>

* Now execute the following command in the terminal:

```sh
pip3 install git+https://github.com/strath-sdr/rfsoc_ofdm
```

The notebook should now be available in the `ofdm-demonstrator` folder in your Jupyter Workspace.
It is important that you use the Chrome web browser if possible as rendering performance is important.
